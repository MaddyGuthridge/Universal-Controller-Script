# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, I only provide software support for the latest stable release and 
the latest beta. For example, if the latest stable version is 1.1.2, I will
provide software support for 1.1.x and 1.2.0-beta.x. If I release a version 
that adds incompatibility with an old version of FL Studio, I may support that
branch for a little while longer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although for a project of this nature, I do not expect there to be any 
security vulnerabilities, if you find any security issues, please contact me
at hdsq@outlook.com.au, or on Discord at HDSQ#2154.
