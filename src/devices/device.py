class Device:

    Base class for device types.

    All device objects should inherit from this definition and implement its
    functions.

    ## Methods to implement:
    For full documentation, refer to the docstrings for each function.

    ### Class methods

    * `create(cls, event: Optional[FlMidiMsg]) -> Device`: create an instance
      of this device

    ### Static methods

    * `getUniversalEnquiryResponsePattern() -> Optional[IEventPattern]`:
      Get the event pattern for a universal device enquiry response

    * `matchDeviceName(name: str) -> bool`: Return whether this device matches
      the given name of a device (used as a fallback method for device
      matching)

    * `getDrumPadSize() -> tuple[int, int]`: Return the number of rows and
      columns in the drum pad grid.

    ### Instance methods

    * `getId(self) -> str`: Return the device ID

    * `getDeviceNumber(self) -> int`: Return the device number

    ## Optional methods

    * `initialize(self)`: Called when we initialize the device

    * `deinitialize(self)`: Called when we deinitialize the device

    * `tick(self)`: Called frequently to allow for
      devices to perform any required actions.
