class Integration:
    """
    Represents a script integration, which is used to describe how the script
    should interact with an FL Studio window, or a VST or FL plugin.

    Plugins can be of three types:

    * `PluginIntegration`: used for VST and FL plugins

    * `WindowIntegration`: used for FL Studio windows (mixer, piano roll, etc)

    * `CoreIntegration`: used when the integration should always be active, or
      should at least be active based on a criteria within its own control

    Integration definitions can be created by extending one of these types.
    The base `Integration` type shouldn't be extended.

    For more info, refer to docs/contributing/plugins/README.md

        associated callbacks to be called correctly. Generally, you won't want
