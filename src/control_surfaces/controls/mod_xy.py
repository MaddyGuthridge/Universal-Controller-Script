    ModXY controls are a 2D cartesian control surface, where the position of
    some controller (such as a finger or slider) in the grid determines the
    properties of both the X and Y coordinates. These coordinates can then be
    bound to controls to allow for advanced sound manipulation, particularly
    in live performance.

    ModXY is an abstract class. Devices should implement a ModX and a ModY
    control separately.
