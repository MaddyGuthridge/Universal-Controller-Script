    Defines a switch active button, which is handled internally to switch

    `getContext().activity.setSplitWindowsPlugins(self, value: bool)`

    addressed independently.

    * `SwitchActiveWindowButton` for a button to switch to windows
    * `SwitchActiveToggleButton` for a button to toggle between windows and
      plugins
