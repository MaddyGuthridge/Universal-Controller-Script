    Jog wheels (rotary encoders) are an endless rotating knob that is used for
    navigation. Compared to endless knobs, they should be mapped to navigation
    controls, rather than standard parameters.

    Note that although the control surface is different, all these controls
    could be triggered through a single control, by mapping to different
    controls depending on context.

    NOTE: Jog wheels use the JOG values found in the `control_surfaces.consts`
    module for specifying directions. This is because they aren't used for
    managing relative values.
