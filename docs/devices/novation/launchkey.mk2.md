# Novation LaunchKey Mk2

## Setup

Continuing from the primary setup instructions.

1. Open FL Studio's MIDI Settings, and set a port for the controller listed as
   `MIDIIN2 (Novation Launchkey Mk2)` in both the input and output sections.
   Assign this device to the controller type "Universal Event Forwarder (user)",
   so that events from this script can be forwarded to the main script to be
   processed.

## Device Details

* If configured correctly, the device's InControl lights should turn on when
  FL Studio starts, and turn off when FL Studio closes.

* The clip launch buttons are mapped to be a control switch button and a
  metronome button, respectively.
