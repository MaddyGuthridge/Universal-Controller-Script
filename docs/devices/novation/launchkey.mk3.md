## Setup

Continuing from the primary setup instructions.

1. Assign the second MIDI port for your device to the Universal Event
   Forwarder.

## Device Details

* The right-facing arrow button next to the drum pads is mapped to be a
  control switch button.

### 25, 37

* The stop/solo/mute button can be used to open a menu that allows the drum
  pads to mute and solo tracks on the mixer, channel rack, and playlist.

### 49, 61, 88
* The stop/solo/mute button can be used to pause updating the active plugin,
  so that controls will continue to be mapped to that plugin.

Note that the Launchkey Mk3 88 is currently untested, and may not be detected
by the script. Let me know if it works for you!!!
