# Akai MPK Mini Mk3

## Setup

Continuing from the primary setup instructions.

1. Use the `PROG SELECT` button and select the FL Studio 20 preset (bottom
   right drum pad).

## Device Details

* In FPC, the banks of drums are the wrong way around. There sadly isn't much
  I can do about this.

* Currently, there is no distinction between notes, CCs and Program Changes on 
  the drum pads. Let me know if you want me to implement something for this.
