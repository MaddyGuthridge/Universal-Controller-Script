# Korg NanoKontrol

Note that I don't have access to this device, so I can't verify that it works
correctly. I created the definition from an old script when I did own the
device. If anything doesn't work for you, please let me know and we can
troubleshoot it and get you a fix!

## Setup

Please reset your device to its factory defaults, as otherwise controls won't
be bound correctly. Follow the instructions in the
[manual](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/manual/1/252/3079/).

## Device Details

* Only Scene 1 is mapped - if you switch to other scenes then it won't behave
  correctly. If you want me to add support for other scenes, let me know!

* The loop button is mapped to be a control switch button, meaning that it
  switches between plugin modes for support plugins.

## Who to contact
