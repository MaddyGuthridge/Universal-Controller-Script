# Roadmap

I have huge plans for the Universal Controller Script! Here are some of the
features I'm looking to build into it. If you have any other ideas, feel free
to [create an issue](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script/issues/new/choose).

## FL Studio integration

* Improved step sequencer integration, including controlling properties of
  various steps.

* Support for live performance.

* Support for browser navigation.

## Device support

* Launchpads and other similar devices.

* Screens on the Novation SL.

* Using the pitch wheel to support quick scrolling when a shift button is
  pressed.

## Plugin support

I don't have the hugest collection of plugins, so if you want to see a plugin
supported, please let me know!
