# Mixer

Basic mappings to FL Studio's mixer window.

Note that all controls map to the selected tracks. Changing the selection will
change which tracks are affected by the changes. The affected tracks will be
highlighted using a red rectangle on the mixer window.

## Mappings
* Faders to volume of highlighted tracks
* Knobs to pan of highlighted tracks
* Generic fader buttons to mute and solo (double press) of highlighted tracks
* Mute, solo, arm and select buttons to respective controls for highlighted
  tracks
* Jog wheel to track selection
* Move Jog wheel to track multi-selection
