# Spitfire Audio

Basic mappings most of Spitfire Audio's dedicated plugins.

Note that I'm unable to test this with some plugins as I don't own them. If you
run into any issues with plugin detection, let me know and I can fix it.

## Mappings
* First 2 faders to expression and dynamics
* Drum pads to keyswitch selection
